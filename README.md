# Hero-vs-Villain
In this project there will be a question asked from the users that is do you want to add a character or do you want them to fight.
If you type "a" for add, it will go into a loop where there is a "Hero" class that has many elements. 
Like name, smartness, strength, power, fashion, looks and speed that will all be asked from the user. 
With each of these, first it will get each one and then set it to the input. 
To get an average score, it will add all of the elemts and then divide them by 6.
This was all about the hero and it will do the same exact thing with the villains. 
After you have added all of your characters and type "f" for fight, it will get out of the loop and will make them fight.
It will randomly pick a villain and a hero to fight and print their names.
With an if statement it will determine wether the average score of the villain is higher and they one or the hero has one.
